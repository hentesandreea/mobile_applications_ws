<h2>What I've done using JavaScript and React Native</h2>
<p>From 99 JavaScript exercises I've completed more than 50, exercising my knowledge in JavaScript.These exercises helped me understand how to use functions, methods and objects.</p>
<p>At the first introductive workshop for React Native I've learned how to edit a text.</p>
<p>In the 2nd workshop of React I've learned how to make  basic components such as: Text inputs, buttons.</p>
<p>As a homework I've created multiple components to expand and develop my skills.</p>
<p>The components I've created are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>City card</li>
  <img src ="./readme_photos/CityCard.jpg" width = "300" height ="500"/> 
  <li>Badge</li>
  <img src ="./readme_photos/badge.jpg" width = "300" height ="500"/> 
  <li>Downloader</li>
  <img src ="./readme_photos/Downloader_Component.jpg" width = "300" height ="500"/> 
  <li>Weather card</li>
  <img src ="./readme_photos/WeatherCard_Component.jpg" width = "300" height ="500"/> 
  <li>Header</li>
  <img src ="./readme_photos/Header_Component.jpg" width = "300" height ="500"/> 
  <li>Visa card</li>
  <img src ="./readme_photos/Card_Component.jpg" width = "300" height ="500"/> 
  <li>Login screen</li>

</ul>
