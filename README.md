<h2>What I've done using JavaScript and React Native</h2>
<p>From 99 JavaScript exercises I've completed more than 50, exercising my knowledge in JavaScript.These exercises helped me understand how to use functions, methods and objects.</p>
<p>At the first introductive workshop for React Native I've learned how to edit a text.</p>
<p>In the 2nd workshop of React I've learned how to make a basic components such as: Text input, buttons.</p>
<p>As a homework I've created a City Card using a button an image and I've exercised working with components.</p>
<p>I have also created a personal card which helped me  understand better how to work with texts, images and containers.</p>
